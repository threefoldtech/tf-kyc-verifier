# Production Setup

In an ideal production setup, we will need multiple instances of the service running behind a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly. This ensures scalability, prevents any single instance from being overwhelmed, and provides fault tolerance.

The services should connect to a self-hosted MongoDB database configured for high availability. This involves setting up a replica set to ensure data redundancy and automatic failover, minimizing downtime in case of node failures.

## Key Components

### Load Balancer

- Distributes incoming requests across multiple service instances to optimize performance and prevent overload.
- Provides fault tolerance by rerouting traffic if any instance goes offline.
- Example: Nginx, HAProxy, or Traefik.

### High-Availability MongoDB Setup (Self-Hosted)

- Replica Set:
  - Consists of one primary node (for reads/writes) and one or more secondary nodes (for replication).
  - If the primary node fails, a secondary is automatically promoted to primary.
- Arbiter Node: (Optional)
  - Participates in elections without storing data, ensuring smooth primary promotion in case of failure.
- Backup Strategy:
  - Regular backups to avoid data loss. Backups should be stored encrypted in a remote location to ensure data security and durability.
- Example Setup: 1 primary, 2 secondary nodes, and 1 optional arbiter for quorum.
- Hosted on virtual machines or bare metal servers to ensure full control over the infrastructure.

This architecture ensures that the system remains operational even during node failures, while the load balancer helps manage traffic efficiently. Regular backups and monitoring of the MongoDB cluster will further enhance reliability and minimize the risk of data loss.
